## Supervised learning Challenge 20 Assignment

* For this assignment there were three requirements as given below:

* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

      * Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
      * Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
      * Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
  
      * Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
      * Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.
      * Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:
  
            * Generate a confusion matrix.
            * Print the classification report.
            * Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report which includes the following
  
      * An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
      * The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
      * A summary: Summarise the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

Files Information:

      * The file "credit_risk_classification.ipynb” is used to complete this analysis and it resides in "Credit_Risk" folder.       
      * The file "lending_data.csv" is used for reading the data and it resides in "Credit_Risk\Resources" folder.
      * The file "Credit Risk Analysis Report.md" with the analysis report is in "Credit_Risk" folder.
